# Python Homework Solution: The financial/budgeting analysis of PyBank data and election/voting analysis of PyPoll data

## Background

In this homework assignment, I wrote python code to analyze 2 real application scenarios: a company's financial data, and candidates' election data.

### Before reading the homework csv data files and coding in Python

1. I created a new repository in GitHub for this project called `Python-Challenge`. 

2. Inside the new repository:
    * I cloned the new repository to my computer.
    * Inside my local Git repository, I create a folder for each Python assignment and named them PyBank and PyPoll.
    * In each folder that I created (PyBank and PyPoll), I add the following content:
      -	A new file called main.py, which is the main Python script that runs for each analysis.
      -	A Resources folder that contains the CSV files I used; budget_data.csv and election_data.csv, respectively. 
      -	An Analysis folder that contains the text file that will store the results from each analysis; financial_analysis.txt and election_analysis.txt, respectively.
    * I pushed these changes back to GitHub. 

### Files including data used for analysis and the solution output

* PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv - Ran Python code on this PyBank assignment data to generate the final solution output.  
* PyBank/Analysis/financial_analysis.txt is the final solution output for PyBank assignment.

* PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv - Ran Python code on this PyPoll assignment data to generate the final solution output.  
* PyBank/Analysis/election_analysis.txt is the final solution output for PyPoll assignment.

### Python coding files,*.py

* PyBank/main.py - Ran this Python code to generate the final analysis and print the output for PyBank assignment

* PyPoll/main.py - Ran this Python code to generate the final analysis and print the output for PyPoll assignment 

## Analysis Steps

1. Created a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and generated output for the following information:
  	* The ticker symbol.
  	* Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  	* The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
	* The total stock volume of the stock.

2. Used conditional formatting that highlighted positive yearly change in green and negative yearly change in red.

3. Added functionality to the script to return the stock ticker with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". 

4. Made the appropriate adjustments to the VBA script to allow it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) just by running the VBA script once.
